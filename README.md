# Intuition
The problem involves finding a falling path from the top to the bottom of a square grid with non-zero shifts. This means choosing one element from each row while avoiding choosing elements from the same column in adjacent rows. Our goal is to find the minimum sum of such a falling path.

Initially, we can start with a dynamic programming approach, where we maintain an array of the minimum sum of falling paths up to each cell in the grid. By iterating through each row, we calculate the minimum sum for each cell based on the previous row while ensuring the non-zero shifts constraint.

# Approach
1. Initialization: Use a 2D array dp to store the minimum sum of falling paths up to each cell in the grid. Start by copying the values from the input grid.
2. Row Iteration: For each row, starting from the second row, calculate the minimum sum for each cell in the row. To optimize the approach, calculate the two smallest values and their indices in the previous row in a single pass.
3. Calculate Minimum Sum: For each cell in the current row, use the two smallest values from the previous row to calculate the minimum sum of the falling path to that cell. If the cell is in the same column as the minimum sum's index, use the second smallest value. Otherwise, use the smallest value.
4.Find the Result: Once the entire grid is processed, find the minimum sum in the last row of the dp array.
By using the two smallest values approach, the inner loop complexity is reduced, making the overall approach more efficient.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity is approximately O(n^2) because we iterate through each cell in the grid exactly once, calculating the minimum sum from the previous row in constant time (since we calculate the two smallest values in a single pass).
- Space complexity:
The space complexity is approximately O(n^2) because we use a 2D array dp of size n x n to store the minimum sums up to each cell in the grid. Since the problem constraints allow modifying the input grid in place, we could optimize space complexity to O(n) by reusing the input grid for the dp array.
